# Overview

* **Research Question:** Are businesses more/less resilient to certain infrastructure disruptions?
  * I.e., Are losses from some disruption types more/less avoidable?

* **Who cares?** 
  * Policy makers, city planners, disaster managers, individual firms

* **Data** 
  * Survey from firms affected by Hurricane Harvey

* **Contributions**
  * Resilience measurement 
  * Empirical framework to guide further research

# What is resilience?

* Ability of a system to absorb shocks
  * Focus on the **bounce-back** to normal or a "new" normal 

* Economic Resilience:
  * Focus on actions that occur after an event with the goal of reducing business interruptions (BI)
  * *Efficient* use of remaining resources
